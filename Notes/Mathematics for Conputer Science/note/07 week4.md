### Definition

Relationships between elements of sets are represented using the structure called a relation, which is just a subset of the Cartesian product of the sets.

​    Antisymmetric and Symmetric is not opposite

> if only (a,a) in R, it is both Symmetric and Antisymmetric 

#### Transitive Relations

### Combining Relations

Because relations from *A* to *B* are subsets of *A* *×* *B*, two relations from *A* to *B* can be combined in any way two sets can be combined.

#### Combining Relations: Composite
