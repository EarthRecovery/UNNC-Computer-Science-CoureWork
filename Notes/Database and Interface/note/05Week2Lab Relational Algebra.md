2.1.1 **b**

2.1.2 **a**

2.1.3 **c**

> R-S:
>
> 4 2 3 
>
> 1 2 6
>
> S-R:
>
> 2 5 4
>
> 2 7 3

2.2.1  **d**

> option b : and c don't exist in the cartesian set
>
> option a : R.A > S.C

2.3.1  **b**

> the name order is (C, B), so only tuple (6,5) fit

2.4.1 **d**

> option c: R.B != S.B
>
> option a,b : tuple (g,7,8) and (c,7,8) don't exist in cartesian set

2.5 **d**

> the function use Union in the middle, so neither Application have GPA  > 19 nor applications apply for CS.

2.6  **a**

> the order of selection is:
>
> 1. subject is CS
> 2. The school is in London
> 3. HS > Enrollment

2.7  **b**

> because the natural join operator automatically sets values equal when attribute names are the same, and in this question, the GPA and HS have the same attribute name. But for the Student Table is the same, the number of tuples will be the same as 20.

2.8  **a** 

> Because university names in Apply also appear in University, the minimum number of uName is 5 (number of University). the function react in Student table translate sName to uName, if all the sName is the same and also same to the uName in University, the total number will not change, Otherwise, the maximum of tuples will become 25
