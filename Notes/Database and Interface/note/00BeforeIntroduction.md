- DBI recently changed from being a 20-credit module to a 10-credit module. 

  As a result of this change, we have a limit selection of representative exam papers for this “new” 10-credit module. Whilst there is a significant overlap in style and content between the two versions of the module, there may be questions in past papers that are not representative. If you encounter a question interrogating content we have not covered, this year, please ignore it.

  The exam will only include questions for topics we've covered in labs and lectures. For additional questions/examples, please consult the module textbook, which contains many questions at the end of each chapter.
