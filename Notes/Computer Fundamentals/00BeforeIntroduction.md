### Lecture Schedule

- **Lecture schedule:**

  - Wednesday     11:00-13:00, DB-A05
  - Thursday       9:00-10:00, DB-A05

  Please bring pens, paper, etc, to lectures as you will need to make notes based on what the conveners are saying and doing. The lecture slides will not show all the information in the course; they are summaries of what I am saying and doing during the lectures.

  If you wish to make notes using a laptop or tablet then we are ok with that but:

  - **you must run your device using the battery. It is too dangerous to have power cables running across the lecture room floor.**
